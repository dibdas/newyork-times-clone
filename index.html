          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
             physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
             Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
             venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

             <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
               that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might
                have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
                course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special 
                energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                 speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
             <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess.
             The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
             se particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
             like spit in the ocean.</p>

            </p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top
             of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="second-article">
               <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                  reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
                  hypothesis,known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
               <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
                 <a class="blue-highlight">the first sliver of
                    cosmic time</a> telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers 
                    led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
                    detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                    <a class="blue-highlight">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a 
                    universe being wrenched violently apart when
                    it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
                     old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
                      Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

          <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
             including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
             <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science 
            comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe 
            apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and 
            space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
              <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 
              14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is 
              only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and 
              fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an 
              endless
               number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
               water boiling over.

             <p>In our own universe, it would serve as  window into the forces 
               operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
                on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                 Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                 gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
                 general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>

              <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert 
                who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
              <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
              <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath 
                of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
                 the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
                  of the sun.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as 
                Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, 
                reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                 Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The 
                 Astrophysical Journal.</p>
