          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
             physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
             Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
             venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

             <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
               that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might
                have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
                course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
                energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                 speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
             <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess.
             The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
             se particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
             like spit in the ocean.</p>

            </p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top
             of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

                on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                 Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of

              <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
                of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of

                  of the sun.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected
          such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
        <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
        <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of
           nobservations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak,
           Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
           meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
           Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was
           sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
        <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,”
           said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
           telescopes.</p>
           <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theoriAndrei Linde of Stanford, a
             prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
             known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the
             Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of
             Dr. Kovac’s team, <a class="blue-highlight">
              knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne </a>to tell him
              the news.</p>

        <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
        <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anyt
          simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
          email.</p>
        <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
          hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,
          ” he said.</p>
        <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had
          been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of
          jubilation and caution.</p>
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”

        <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a
           competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
          impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>

        <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
           posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true,
            the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
            inflation.</p>

        <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
            confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
            temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s
          Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>

        <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,
          ” Dr. Krauss said.</p>

       <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
           findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements
           from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>


    <p class="h2-heading" >Spirals in the Sky</p>

         <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
             microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
             at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
          He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
           sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal
           observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota,
           Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

        <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
          ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over
           in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

        <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
            polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one
            direction rather than another.</p>

        <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
            from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it
              in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the
             microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky
             should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>

        <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope,
          Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>

        <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

        <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
          burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right
          and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

          <p class="h2-heading" >A Special Time</p>

        <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
          like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
          suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>

        <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
           electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have
            long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
            unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>

        <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
          grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with
          each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
          splitting away.</p>

        <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>

        <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
           temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
           point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
          long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious
          latent energy.</p>

        <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
          antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself
          supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it
          pushed apart.</p>

          <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
            trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
            to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>

        <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
           particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
           resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions
            of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
            free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate
             free lunch.”</p>

        <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
          Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal.
           Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion,
           the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
           endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>

        <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
          asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>

        <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
          because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos
          and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of
           our view.</p>

        <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
          Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team,
           “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
